### A brain-computer interface driven by imagining different force loads on a single hand: an online feasibility study ([pdf](./papers/s12984-017-0307-1%20brain-computer%20interface%20driven%20by%20imagining.pdf)) [^force-loads]

- EEG has standard systems including the "international 10-20 system"
- ref and ground electrodes are used (e.g. nose and prefrontal lobe, respectively, in paper)
- Sampling freqency of 1kHz seems consistent/reasonable as used in paper
- Need notch filter to remove power frequency interference
- Complementary data like electromyogram (EMG) signals can be used on working muscles to validate "motor imagery"

| Motor Imagery | Motor imagery is a mental process by which an individual rehearses or simulates a given action. It is widely used in sport training as mental practice of action, neurological rehabilitation, and has also been employed as a research paradigm in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology to investigate the content and the structure of covert processes (i.e., unconscious) that precede the execution of action.[^MI1] [^MI2] | [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_imagery>) |
